    <p>A mobile phone, cellular phone, cell phone, cellphone, handphone, or hand phone, sometimes shortened to simply
        mobile,
        cell or just phone, is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while
        the user
        is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching
        systems
        of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile
        telephone services use a cellular network architecture and, therefore, mobile telephones are called cellular
        telephones or cell phones in North America. In addition to telephony, digital mobile phones (2G) support a
        variety
        of other services, such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications
        (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, video games and digital photography. Mobile phones offering only
        those capabilities are known as feature phones.</p>

        A laptop, laptop computer, or notebook computer is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a screen and
        alphanumeric keyboard. These typically have a clamshell form factor, typically having the screen mounted on the
        inside of the upper lid and the keyboard on the inside of the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable
        keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a laptop mode. Laptops are folded shut for transportation,
        and thus are suitable for mobile use.[1] Its name comes from lap, as it was deemed practical to be placed on
        a person's lap when being used. Today, laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education,
        for playing games, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and general home computer use.

        Earphones are very small headphones that are fitted directly in the outer ear, facing but not inserted in the
        ear canal.
        Earphones are portable and convenient, but many people consider them uncomfortable.[22] They provide hardly any
        acoustic
        isolation and leave room for ambient noise to seep in; users may turn up the volume dangerously high to
        compensate, at
        the risk of causing hearing loss.
